# TCGA-LAML downsampling {#ch:tcga-down}

1.24 is taken as the ratio between the mean proportion of mapped reads in the Leucegene and the TCGA-LAML cohorts. This is discussed in the Methods paper.

`TCGA-LAML-multiqc_samtools_flagstat.txt` was created using the `samtools flagstat` function.

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

tcga <- read.delim("data/TCGA-LAML-multiqc_samtools_flagstat.txt")
info_tcga <- subset(tcga,select=c("Sample","mapped_passed","total_passed","total_failed","secondary_passed","secondary_failed")) %>%
  mutate(total_reads = (total_failed - secondary_failed) + (total_passed - secondary_passed),
         prop_mapped_passed = (mapped_passed - secondary_passed)/total_reads)

info_tcga$total_passed_no_secondary <- info_tcga$mapped_passed - info_tcga$secondary_passed
summary(info_tcga$total_passed_no_secondary/2/1000000) # divide by two as flagstats reports the number of reads not fragments

tot_reads <- info_tcga %>%
  dplyr::select(Sample,total_reads) %>% # total_reads is the sum of both Reads1 and Reads2
  mutate(Prop40 = round((80000000/total_reads)*1.24,2)) %>%
  separate(Sample, into = c("Name"),sep="[.]") %>%   # 80000000 = target number of reads, double the fragments 
  dplyr::select(Name,Prop40,total_reads) 

write_csv(tot_reads,"data/AdditionalTables/TableS4-downsampling-proportion-TCGA-LAML.csv")
```
